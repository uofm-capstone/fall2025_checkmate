Formal feedback from Jeralyn Saenz to Lawrence Jones 

Lawrence showed me his Kanban board and his progress on deploying their app from google cloud. He also showed me the process he went through 
installing and initializing the app. He mostly spoke about what he hopes to complete because he is having trouble deploying the app on his 
machine and running the trigger. He and his team are still working on it, but from what I can tell, they’ve made good progress. I’m looking 
forward to seeing what they accomplish in Sprint 3.
