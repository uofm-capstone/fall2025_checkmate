Feedback to @Jonnie (from Dev)
- Summary
    - Fixed the sprint links in repositories/show by hardcoding default sprint start/end dates
    - Partially refactor semesters_controller.rb
- Comments
    - Thanks for organizing the changes into a PR (good organization)
    - Try to make more incremental & smaller commits so the diffs arenâ€™t huge
    - Good job with feeling out the codebase and making small changes to review how it affects functionality; especially given the lack of comments.
    - Dependencies (node_modules) should not be checked into GitHub; they need to be `.gitignore`d and installed in developer environments like Ruby gems.
- Plans to Address feedback:
    - Since I have a better grasp of codebase I should be able to contribute more the code. 
    - Will be more mindful of the my commits by trying to commit more frequently. 
    - Will try to address the dependencies stuff with the team during sprint 3.
