Feedback Recieved: Make it easier to build and test with the Docker container locally and document it. 

Plans to Address: 
- Build a docker-compose.yml so that, when building container locally it can connect to the database.
- Write instructional documentation about how to set up docker, build and test locally, and document how it works with gcloud.
