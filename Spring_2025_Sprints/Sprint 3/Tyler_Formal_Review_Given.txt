Meeting Type: Emperical Usability 

Walking through application (after navigating to training, completing week one  & two training): 
    - My training results for week 2 do not appear after completing week 2 training 
    - Training page has difficult buttons for everyone to locate instantly

Feedback given:
UI could benefit from:
- More noticable buttons

Backend needs to show the results of trainings beyond week 1.
