-	Jeralyn showed me the features the HPV group implemented: home page, the map, and assessments.
-	There are some Spanish related questions in place of the actual questions regarding HPV vaccination.
-	There is a QR code you must scan through the terminal in order to access the app. The app is called Expo go.
-	The map feature shows the nearest clinics you can visit.

Feedback:
-	Fix the map features so you can see the “Find the clinics near you”
-	Make the map to where you can navigate it easier.
-	Try to implement some questions for the user about their health.
-	Create questions for the user pertaining to any prior vaccinations.


Courtney Colbert:
- I like the attention to detail. I like the switch from basic to advanced search button feature.
- There was an issue where the search feature did not have any records shown.
- The manage function crashed when attempting to create new record.
- The Contact page had good data.

Feedback:
- News page needs more content and better styling.
- About page needs more detailed styling, animated gif needs more work done
- Contact page needs more styling.
