== TO: Aidan Johnson ==

- Could have placeholders/default stuff for profiles to make look less empty. 
- Could have ‘other’ option on email form.
- Email form and sent email looks good.
- Some cool future stuff to have is a profile relationship with profiles 
The website looks generally good; functionality looks good.
