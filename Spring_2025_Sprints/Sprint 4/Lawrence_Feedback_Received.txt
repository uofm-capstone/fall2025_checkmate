Formal Evaluation and Feedback
Project: TAG
Student: Lawrence Jones
Feedback by: Jessica Edwards


Clarity of Objectives: TAG gives an explicit explanation of the team’s objective which is to create an application that will help professors 
and/or teacher’s assistants to grade assignments, specifically capstone projects.

Methodology and Design: The TAG project takes on user driven design, which includes functions like authentication, semester management, team 
creation, and project grading workflows. It provides a clean template that helps with readability, functionality and simplicity that aids in the 
application being user-friendly and efficient. Also, the implication of authentication allows for only authorized professors and teachers’ 
assistants to access the application. 

Technical Implementation: TAG provides an easier setup for developers using Docker. Docker holds it consistency across different environments. 
It can make the project more professional, easier to manage, and implementation stronger. Using Ruby on Rails, following a Model-View-Controller 
design on the backend, maintained a clear separation on concerns within the project.


Overall Assesment:  The project successfully meets its core objective of providing a fast, efficient grading tool for professors and teaching 
assistants. By offering a simple interface which includes a login-based access system, structured semester and team management, and a clean, 
minimal workflow. The Rails' MVC architecture makes the app easy to maintain and extend and the basic authentication ensures that sensitive 
grading operations are restricted to authorized users only.
